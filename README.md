Hello, this is simple project that calculates BMI

Here is home, about, history,bmiCalculator

I have route.js and its routes are in the package route/ bmiRoutes.js

I have added 2 additional inputs for the bmi calculator: age, gender (mandatory). Also, there are name, weight, height

The units of height and weight are divided like cm, mm, m and g, kg, respectively.

History part was quite difficult because from bmiRoutes was not directly sending the document JSON format file to the html file
So I have made it by button clicking using the method POST
Used for html Bootstrap

"test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1", "start": "nodemon route.js"
You can start by nodemon route.js or node route.js
